            <div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-lg space-y-6">
                <p>In the heart of a deep jungle, a lion pride thrived under the ever-present guidance of a mysterious voice known only as the Elder above Elders. Revered and unquestionable, the Elder spoke from the shadows beneath trees and shrubs, issuing commands that shaped every aspect of the pride’s life. The lions obeyed without hesitation, their loyalty fierce as their roars.</p>
                <p>The Elder often gave good advice, yet every so often: the Elder gave strange commands.<br>“Go eat the grass,” it once decreed.</p>
                <p>Though puzzled, the lions obeyed, grazing on bitter blades that filled their bellies with nothing but irritation and doubt. Still, not a single lion dared to question. Not even the oldest of their pride.</p>
                <p>None, that is, except for Jorge, a young and small lion with restless eyes and a passion for understanding. The leaves could not fill his hunger, yet their presence only blazened Jorge’s appetite for knowledge.</p>
                <p>Driven by unease, Jorge left the pride and set off alone across the desert. Through bright burning days and sweet, sultry starlight nights, he followed the whispers of the Elder above Elder’s voice to a place forgotten by most. A cave at the edge of the desert, where light nor animal could be seen for miles.</p>
                <p>Inside, the air smelled of mushrooms and rot. The walls teemed with decay. At the center, Jorge unearthed the truth:</p>
                <p>A massive, glistening worm, coiled among the bones of long-dead lions and animals of the desert. Not even light would bounce of its sinewy length.<br>“I am the Elder above Elders,” it said, in the exact same voice that ruled the pride.<br>“I know what was, and thus I know what must be.”</p>
                <p>Yet, Jorge watched as the worm fed: not on wisdom, but on corpses. He realized that its so-called “knowledge” came from the decomposed memories of the dead, digested and distorted into commands. The Elder above Elders was no oracle, no god…. Just a mouth that echoes the past without any understanding of the present.</p>
                <p>Jorge returned to the pride, his heart heavy with truth. He told them what he had seen. Many roared in denial, clinging to the comfort of obedience and tradition.</p>
                <p>But others listened.<br>One by one, the pride began to remember how they got their name, and learned to foster, and listen to, the courageous voice within their own blazing hearts instead.</p>
